Steps to re-image the node
1) Migrate service off the node
2) Stop the STONITH service associated with the node
) delete the node and client objects in the associated org in the chef server
4) Trigger the re-image of the node via Holly (I'll do that when ready)
5) Once the node has come back up it will re-join chef and have just Basenode as a run list - update the run list to the desired run list, e.g. add AW1Basenode and Bock-Single-Machine as roles
6) run the following knife edb grants:
knife edb grant icinga_rabbitmq amqp_wrapper_password_dev -q roles:Bock-Server-Base
knife edb grant logaggr creds_dev -q roles:Bock-Server-Base
7) Run this command in a checked out bock-chef repo
./tools/bock_edb_grant --location dev_rdb_az1 --run_cmds
 log in to the node and run chef-client (via chef-safe-run if you want, and just ignore the complaints about monit)
 
 To set roles, log in to OpsCode:
