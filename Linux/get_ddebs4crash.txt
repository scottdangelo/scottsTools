Install the debug symbols packages (ddebs) needed for new kernels.

The version of the kernel that was running when the node crashed is recorded in the dump file; you can extract it using the strings command (for example: strings <dumpfile> | grep Linux -m1 -A7)

In /usr/lib/debug/boot/ on the RCA development system you will find the kernels w/ debug symbols and the symbol tables for all the kernels where we've seen issues so far. If a new kernel is deployed and a dump file is collected you'll need to install the corresponding ddebs.

    get the right ddebs package from Ubuntu
        standard kernel ddebs can be downloaded from http://ddebs.ubuntu.com/pool/main/l  (on RCA dev system do for example;  wget --tries=25 ddebs.ubuntu.com/pool/main/l/linux-lts-quantal/linux-image-3.5.0-46-generic-dbgsym_3.5.0-46.70~precise1_amd64.ddeb )
        if the crash was on a kernel w/ a specific patch or hotfix that was created for HP, request the ddebs package in the Canonical case that requested that kernel build.
    install the package on the RCA dev system (sudo dpkg -i <ddebs-file>)
        the vmlinux file will be installed into /usr/lib/debug/boot
    copy the System.map file from the /boot dir on the node where the crash happened to /usr/lib/debug/boot on the RCA system
    rename the System.map and vmliux file in /usr/lib/debug/boot w/ the "extension" provided by "uname -a" so that the ddebs for similar kernels don't get mixed up.
