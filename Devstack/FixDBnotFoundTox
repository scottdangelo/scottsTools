In openstack/python-novaclient project, run test in py27 env, then run test in py33 env, the following error will stop test:

db type could not be determined

But, if you run "tox -e py33" fist, then run "tox -e py27", it will be fine, no error.

workaround: remove the file in .testrepository/time.dbm, then run py33 test, it will be fine.
