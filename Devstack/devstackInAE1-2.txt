Cool. I'm on production, so no need to set the HOST_IP

yes
also, if using ae1-2 - the default dns config seems flakey/broken atm at least, you should edit your subnet and remove the 168.x addr temporarily
you can try re-ordering but the MC seems to decide its own order anyway so removing seems safer
I added in googles easy to reember 8.8.8.8 as an alternative
