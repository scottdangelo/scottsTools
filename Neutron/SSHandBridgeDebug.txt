Cannot ssh to instance
1) Security groups 
port 22 TCP
all ICMP 
2) Is the floating IP addr routable from the client?
route -n # on client
Verify that public subnet in OpenStack is accessible from client
(eg. for local LAN, that it matches 192.168.0.0/24)
3) bridges OK?

Bridge Issues
ovs-vsctl show  #is ethernet card attached to same bridge as public network?

neutron router show router1   #are the private subnet and public subnet connected to the router?

ip netns exec <public_namespace_id> ping <floating_ip>  #does the public network match the local LAN exactly?

ip netns exec < public_namespace_id> route -n  #is traffic being correctly routed from the instance out?
