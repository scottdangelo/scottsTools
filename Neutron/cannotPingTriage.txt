1. Make sure 'nova list' shows the instance as ACTIVE

2. Check the console log of the instance for failures, especially DHCP and metadata.  For example, you should see a section like this:

ci-info: lo    : 1 127.0.0.1       255.0.0.0       .
ci-info: eth0  : 1 10.0.0.3        255.255.255.0   fa:16:3e:e4:fa:a6
ci-info: route-0: 0.0.0.0         10.0.0.1        0.0.0.0         eth0   UG
ci-info: route-1: 10.0.0.0        0.0.0.0         255.255.255.0   eth0   U

No IP, or "route info failed" are bad.

3. Run tcpdump in the various namespaces - router "qr" device, dhcp "ns" device and verify packets are being seen from the instance.  If not, run tcpdump right on the instance tap device.

4. Look for any errors in the log files, especially the neutron ones.
