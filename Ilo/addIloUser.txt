Hey folks, eh @all even, I raised a ticket requesting iLO users for mq nodes and I got a response saying:
"The service teams usually create their own ilo users (talk to bock)."
So here I am talking to Bock :) can anyone tell me what I need to do?

There was talk of creating an 'official' way of doing it, so that various recipes don't fight over it, but that didn't happen

    you might need to change the channel "2" depending on what env you are running in
    Dave McNally

    I'll make sure I check that
    Cian O'Driscoll

    i think ae1-2 has an admin user already in channel 2
