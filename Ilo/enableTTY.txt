enabled a getty on the vsp for stratus47 to check if working - in /etc/init/ttyS1.conf if you want to remove....
as in delete the file to remove

start on runlevel 2
start on runlevel 3

stop on runlevel 0
stop on runlevel 1
stop on runlevel 4
stop on runlevel 5
stop on runlevel 6

respawn
exec /sbin/getty -L 9600 ttyS1

also if you modify the kernel parameters to console=ttyS1 then you'd see the console output as well on the vsp - but whether that's what you want or not is up to you
