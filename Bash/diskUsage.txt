Here are 4 commands i use for checking out disk usages.

#Grabs the disk usage in the current directory
alias usage='du -ch | grep total'
#Gets the total disk usage on your machine
alias totalusage='df -hl --total | grep total'
#Shows the individual partition usages without the temporary memory values
alias partusage='df -hlT --exclude-type=tmpfs --exclude-type=devtmpfs'
#Gives you what is using the most space. Both directories and files. Varies on
#current directory
alias most='du -hsx * | sort -rh | head -10'
