hi @MarkMcD , i think @CodySomerville has some progress on that, i rememeber him saying he got hold someone from IT to unblock the https traffic
@MarkMcD you can access jenkins yourself by doing a ssh -D, i can show you how

then configure your browser to use socks proxy on localhost 8080
you should be able, as you have ssh public key in gozer machines
