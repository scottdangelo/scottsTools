In general there is a HC room for each system
For each system there is a Head node that stays static - everything else changes each install
For R106 the head node is 10.22.170.17
For R405 ssh cetest@10.22.157.148

cetest/ceqa123

Once you are on the head node . ./creds_under_admin for UC and . ./creds_over_admin for OC
When you do the OC and "nova list" you will see the nodes and their IPs
You might want to . ./test_venv/bin/activate first though
You can log into the Horizon GUI at the IP found in ./creds_over_admin and using the creds in that file also

Then . ./test_venv/bin/activate
Then . ./creds_under_admin
nova list will now show you the list of nodes and IPs in the system

should also add that when you are on the head node and want to log into an OC node, you can ...
ssh -i .ssh/seed_id_rsa heat-admin@<nodeIP>
e..g. cetest@cer106n0001:~$ ssh -i .ssh/seed_id_rsa heat-admin@10.22.170.104

followed by "sudo su -" and the logs are then in /var/log/upstart

FOR RACK 106:
~$ ssh cetest@10.22.170.17
