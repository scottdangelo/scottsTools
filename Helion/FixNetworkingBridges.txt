 @here do we have a convenient script that will quickly take the only live physical interface off of bridge brbm? I've figured out why cirrus9 isn't playing ball; it can see 192.0.2.{5, 6} on the real network


were you doing real h/w work?

does the virtual install get exposed to the physical network too??

I presume an earlier install on this box has wired up the bridge

well, I'm not doing physical; and I'm not doing virtual until I get this unpicked.


ip addr add 192.168.185.131/16 dev eth0
ovs-vsctl del-port eth0
ip addr del 192.168.185.131/16 dev brbm

put thisin a script
and executes it in the background

bash jan.sh &

actaully bash -x is better

and obviously 131 is MY ip ;-)

I think the routes will fix themselves

in this order
