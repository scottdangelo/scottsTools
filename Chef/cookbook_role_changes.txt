For changes, upload new cookbook AND Role

git co <feature_branch>
Bump the version in metadata.rb:
cat ~/GitRepos/bock-chef/cookbooks/cinder/metadata.rb |grep version
version          "0.0.7"

knife cookbook upload cinder -o cookbooks
knife role from file roles/Cinder-Server-Base.json

~/GitRepos/bock-chef$ knife cookbook show cinder
cinder   0.0.7 0.0.6  0.0.5  0.0.2  0.0.1



To roll back, delete both cookbook AND role

git co master
knife cookbook upload cinder -o cookbooks
knife role from file roles/Cinder-Server-Base.json
~/GitRepos/bock-chef$ knife cookbook show cinder
cinder   0.0.6  0.0.5  0.0.2  0.0.1
