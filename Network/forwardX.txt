@here Question on redirecting X from a server in AE to my workstation
Did I do this correctly ?

On my workstation
    $ sudo xhost +10.22.170.51
    [sudo] password for gfahy:
    10.22.170.51 being added to access control list

On the R106B head node
    root@cer106n0035:/opt/HP/StoreVirtual/UI# export DISPLAY="16.49.34.175:0.0"
    root@cer106n0035:/opt/HP/StoreVirtual/UI# xclock &
    [1] 18394
    root@cer106n0035:/opt/HP/StoreVirtual/UI# Error: Can't open display: 16.49.34.175:0.0
    [1]+  Exit 1                  xclock

@GerryFahy I think the easiest way is to 'ssh -X remotehost' from your work station and then ssh should tunnel X traffic back to your ws

@GerryFahy @oliver you may need the -Y (capital Y) option as well
Otherwise you may encounter some restrictions/issues

@oliver + @fergal Thanks. I used ssh -X -Y and at least xclock works - Thanks - so back to CMC console next ...
