to summarize: 1) if you have problems with "vagrant up" of the deployer failing with: "stderr: tar: ./ansible-2.0.0.tgz: Not found in archive" then remove the content in your hlm-dev-tools/scratch directory.
the good old rm -rf approach

If the hlm-deploy.yml play fails with "Connection failure: timed out", just re-run the play, it will probably work.
